# About Grey Shield Research LLC

Proudly located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we believe in traditional Southwestern American values, such as hard work, perseverance, and respect. We are dedicated to the production of high quality criminal justice research. The science and statistics are always our first priority, and we are uncompromising in our approach to research.

Although we are open to other projects, we specialize in Pre-trial Assessment validation (Incl. the Public Safety Assessment), correctional policy analysis, and other post-arrest studies.

Our staff has a passion for post-arrest criminal justice and criminology. Whether you need a quick statistical report, ongoing data analysis for the Jail Reimbursement Act or PREA, or a partner in a long term project, consider Grey Shield Research.
